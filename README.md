# In this chapter

By default a change in any kind of file will cause a full reload unless HMR is taken care off by the developers themselves.

- Let's add some state to the application
    - Add an interval with a counter
- Change any css property in `style.css`
    - Notice that the counter **does not reset**
- Now change the value of `data/js.arrow`
    - Notice that the counter **resets** because the page is refreshed
- Move to the next step `chapter-2--02`
